# Type Type Type

![sample gameplay](https://github.com/yqliau/type-type-type/blob/07686206760af677b99c5656407c27ecd01e1436/src/assets/type-test.gif "Sample gameplay")

My first React project: a game that tests the player's typing speed.
Features a real-time words-per-minute display, randomly-generated quotes sourced from a third-party API, and a leader-board mechanic with data stored on Firebase.


## How it works
Just start typing to see your current typing speed, measured in words-per-minute. Correct words are highlighted as they are typed. Complete the quote to potentially be added to the leaderboard!

## To-Dos
* Check the 'correctness' of each individual letter typed, and change colours accordingly

## Live site
